# Self-Study PhD in Mathematics

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mathematics at Indiana University. Although I am a student at Indiana University, I consider myself a global learner. I prefer online education, allowing me to study from anywhere, and any platform. One of my favorite platforms is MIT OpenCourseWare, and while I am not an official MIT student, I am at heart.

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to my self-directed PhD studies in Mathematics using MIT OpenCourseWare. While I will continue my traditional education, this repository serves as a supplement to the courses offered by MIT. 

## Goals

- To utilize MIT OpenCourseWare as a comprehensive resource for advanced studies in Mathematics.
- To document and track my progress through the MIT course materials.
- To integrate these learnings with my formal education at Indiana University.

## Repository Contents

- Course Notes
- Problem Sets and Solutions
- Project Work
- Additional Resources

## Contact

For any questions, tips, or collaborations, feel free to reach out to me.
